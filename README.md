# Overview
The AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK consists of two parts, which take use of the resources on the two chips on Arduino Yún, one for native Arduino IDE API access and the other for functionality and connections to AWS IoT service built on top of paho-mqtt python package in MQTT protocol.
### MQTT connection
The AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK provides APIs to let users publish messages to the cloud and subscribe their desired topic to receive messages. This makes it possible for communication between devices and devices/applications. Devices are connected through cloud and sharing data online.
### Thing shadow
The AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK also provides APIs to let users treat their boards as thing shadows in the cloud. Using this SDK, users will be able to sync the data/status of their devices in JSON file form into the cloud and react to the change of status, usually in forms of update command from other applications, by registering a delta function. Users can access and control the board through the cloud.

# Installation
### Download AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK  
Click [here](S3.bucket) to download AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK package.
### Initialize Arduino Yún Board
Please follow the instructions from official website: [Arduino Yún Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYún).

### Mac OS/Linux
Before proceeding to the following steps, please make sure that you have `expect` installed on your computer and correctly installed Arduino IDE.  
To install `expect`:  
For Ubuntu, simply run `sudo apt-get` install `expect`.  
For Mac, `expect` is installed as default.  
For Arduino IDE installation on Linux, please visit [here](http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All).

1. Setup the Arduino Yún board and connect it to WiFi. Obtain its IP address and password.  
2. Make sure your computer is connected to the same network (local IP address range).  
3. Put your AWS IoT CA file, private key and certificate into `./certs`.  
4. Modify `mySCP.sh` and `mySETUP.sh` and replace `[your_boards_IP]` with your board’s IP address and `[your_boards_IP]` with your password (default for Arduino Yún: “arduino”).  
5. Open a terminal, change directory to `AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK-Package`. Do `chmod 755 mySCP.sh` and execute it as `./mySCP.sh`.  
6. Under the same directory, do `chmod 755 mySETUP.sh` and execute it as `./mySETUP.sh`.

  Step 6 can take 15-20 minutes for the device to download and install the required packages (distribute, python-openssl, pip, paho-mqtt).  

  NOTE: Do NOT close the terminal before the script finished, otherwise you have to start over with step 6. Make sure you are in your local terminal before repeating step 6.  

7. Copy and paste `./AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK` folder into Arduino libraries that was installed with your Arduino SDK installation. For Mac OS default, it should be under `Documents/Arduino/libraries`.
8. Restart the Arduino IDE if it was running during the installation. You should be able to see the AWS IoT examples in the Examples folder in your IDE. 

### Windows

Before proceeding to the following steps, please make sure that you have `Putty` and `WinSCP` installed on your PC.  
`Putty` can be found [here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).  
`WinSCP` can be found [here](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php).

1. Setup the Arduino Yún Cloud board and connect it to WiFi. Obtain its IP address and password.  
2. Make sure your PC is connected to the same network (local IP address range).  
3. Put your AWS IoT CA file, private key and certificate into `./certs`.  
4. Start WinSCP and upload `./certs` folder and `aws_iot_mqtt_client.py` to `/root` on the board.  
5. Use Putty to ssh into OpenWRT on your board and execute the following command:

		opkg update
		opkg install distribute
		opkg install python-openssl
		easy_install pip
		pip install paho_mqtt
	
  Step 5 can take 15-20 minutes for the device to download and install the required packages.

6. Copy and paste `./AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK` folder into Arduino libraries that was installed with your Arduino SDK installation. For Windows default, it should be under `Documents/Arduino/libraries`.  
7. Restart the Arduino IDE if it was running during the installation. You should be able to see the AWS IoT examples in the Examples folder in your IDE.

# Usage highlights
**Make sure you have properly installed the AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK and setup the board.**

**Make sure you have properly configured SDK settings in `aws_iot_config.h` inside each sketch directory:**

	//===============================================================
	#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST "data.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com" 	// your endpoint
	#define AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT 8883									// your port
	#define AWS_IOT_CLIENT_ID	"My_ClientID"						// your client ID
	#define AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME "My_Board"						// your thing name
	#define AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_FILENAME "aws-iot-rootCA.crt"           // your root-CA filename
	#define AWS_IOT_CERTIFICATE_FILENAME "cert.pem"                 // your certificate filename
	#define AWS_IOT_PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME "privkey.pem"              // your private key filename
	//===============================================================
	
**Make sure you have included the AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK library:**

    #include <aws_iot_mqtt.h>
    

**Make sure you have included your configuration header file:**

	#include "aws_iot_config.h"

**Make sure you have enough memory for subscribe, messages and sketch runtime. Internal buffer size is defined in SDK library source directory `libraries/AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/aws_iot_config_SDK.h`. The following are default settings:**

	#define MAX_BUF_SIZE 256										// maximum number of bytes to publish/receive
	#define MAX_SUB 15 												// maximum number of subscribe
	#define CMD_TIME_OUT 100										// maximum time to wait for feedback from AR9331, 100 = 10 sec
	#define MAX_SHADOW_TOPIC_LEN 64                                 // maximum length in bytes for shadow topic, the metadata length for shadow topic is 32, make sure your thing name length plus that does not exceed this limit

**Make sure you setup the client, configure it using your configuration and connect it to AWS IoT service first. Remember to use certs path macros for configuration:**

    aws_iot_mqtt_client myClient;
    myClient.setup(AWS_IOT_CLIENT_ID);
    myClient.config(AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST, AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT, AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_PATH, AWS_IOT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH, AWS_IOT_CERTIFICATE_PATH);
    myClient.connnect();

**Remember to check incoming messages in a loop**:

    void loop() { 
      ...  
      myClient.yield();
      ...
    }

**When you are using thing shadow API, make sure you init the shadow with your device thing name first:**

	myClient.shadow_init(AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME);

**When you are using thing shadow API, always make sure MAX\_SUB is big enough for a thing shadow request in the loop:**

	...
	myClient.shadow_get("myThingName", myCallback, 5); // need 2 in MAX_SUB
	...
	void loop() {
		...
		myClient.shadow_get("myThingName", myCallback, 5); // need 4 in MAX_SUB
		myClient.yield(); // unsubscribe thing shadow topics when necessary
		...
	}

**When you are using thing shadow API, make sure you set the timeout to a proper value and frequently call yield to free subscribe resources. Long timeout with low rate of yielding and high rate of shadow request will result in exhaustion of subscribe resources:**

	void loop() {
		...
		myClient.shadow_get("myThingName", myCallback, 5); // 5 sec timeout is fine for a request per 5 sec
		
		// myClient.shadow_get("myThingName", myCallback, 50);
		// 50 sec timeout is too long. When missing feedback happens frequently, with a rate of 1 request per 5 sec, subscribed topics will soon accumulate and exceed MAX_SUB before any of the previously-subscribed topic gets timeout and unsubscribed
		
		myClient.yield();
		
		delay(5000); // 5 sec delay
		...
	}

**Enjoy the Internet of Things!**

# Example
### BasicPubSub
This example demonstrates a simple MQTT publish/subscribe using AWS IoT service from Arduino Yún board. It first subscribes to a topic once and registers a callback to print out new messages to Serial monitor and then publishes to the topic in a loop. Whenever it receives a new message, it will be printed out to Serial monitor indicating the callback function has been called.

* **Hardware Required**  
Arduino Yún  
Computer connected with Arduino Yún using USB serial

* **Software Required**  
None

* **Circuit Required**  
None

* **Code**  
	Create an instance of aws\_iot\_mqtt\_client. 

		aws_iot_mqtt_client myClient;
		
	In `setup()`, open the Serial. Set the instance up and connect it to the AWS IoT service.

		Serial.begin(115200);
		...
		if((rc = myClient.setup(AWS_IOT_CLIENT_ID)) != 0) {
    		Serial.println("Setup failed!");

    		Serial.println(rc);
  		}
  		
  	In `setup()`, subscribe to the desired topic and wait for some delay time.
  	
  	  	if((rc = myClient.subscribe("topic1", 1, msg_callback)) != 0) {
    		Serial.println("Subscribe failed!");
    		Serial.println(rc);
    	}
    	delay(2000);
    	
  	In `loop()`, publish to this topic and call yield function to receive the message every 5 seconds.
  	
  		sprintf(msg, "new message %d", cnt);
  		if((rc = myClient.publish("topic1", msg, strlen(msg), 1, false)) != 0) {
  			Serial.println("Publish failed!");
  			Serial.println(rc);
  		}
		if((rc = myClient.yield()) != 0) {

### ThingShadowEcho
This example demonstrates Arduino Yún board as a device comminucating with AWS IoT service, syncing data into the thing shadow in the cloud and interacting with app command. Whenever there is a new command from the app side to change the desired state of the device, the board will receive this request and apply the change by publishing it as the reported state. By registering a delta callback function, users will be able to see this incoming message and notice the syncing of the state.  

* **Hardware Required**  
Arduino Yún  
Computer connected with Arduino Yún using USB serial

* **Software Required**  
App-side code that updates the state of the corresponding thing shadow in the cloud

* **Circuit Required**  
None

* **Code**  
	Create an instance of aws\_iot\_mqtt\_client. 

		aws_iot_mqtt_client myClient;
		
	Create logging function for execution tracking.
	
		void print_log(char* src, int len) {
			...
		}
	
	In `setup()`, open the Serial. Set the instance up and connect it to the AWS IoT service. Init the shadow and register a delta callback function. All steps are tracked using logging function.

  	For delta callback function, simply parse out the desired state and put it as the reported state in the JSON file that needs to be published.
  	
  		void msg_callback_delta(char* src, int len) {
  			String data = String(src);
  			int st = data.indexOf("\"state\":") + strlen("\"state\":");
  			int ed = data.indexOf(",\"metadata\":");
  			String delta = data.substring(st, ed);
  			String payload = "{\"state\":{\"reported\":";
  			payload += delta;
  			payload += "}}";
  			payload.toCharArray(JSON_buf, 100);
  			print_log("update thing shadow", myClient.shadow_update(AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME, JSON_buf, strlen(JSON_buf), NULL, 5));
  		}
  	
  	Once an update of the desired state of this device comes in, a delta message will be received and displayed in the Serial monitor. The device will update this data into the cloud.
